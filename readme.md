# Dockerfiles for Multiple Programming Languages

This repository contains Dockerfiles for building and running applications in several programming languages, including C, Go, Java, Python, Ruby, Rust, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use these Dockerfiles, you must have Docker installed on your machine. You can download Docker for your operating system from the official [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

## Building the Docker Images

To build the Docker images for the programming languages you want to use, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory for the language you want to use. For example, if you want to build a Python image, navigate to the `python` directory.
3. Run the following command to build the Docker image:

docker build -t <image-name> .

Replace `<image-name>` with a name for your Docker image. For example, if you're building a Python image, you might use `python-image` as the image name.

## Running the Docker Images

To run the Docker images you've built, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command to start a Docker container using the image you've built:
docker run --rm -it <image-name>

Replace `<image-name>` with the name of the Docker image you built earlier.
